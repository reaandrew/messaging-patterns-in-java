Feature: Callers can issue commands to Application "A" asynchronously.
  As a caller of Application "A"
  I want to issue commands asynchronously to Application "A"
  So that I am not blocked by availability issues with Application "A" or its dependencies.

  Scenario: Receiving a CorrelationID for a given request
    Given Application "A" exists
    When I submit a command to Application "A"
    Then I receive a response which contains a CorrelationID
    And I receive a response with an Accepted HTTP Status Code

  Scenario: Receiving a Redirect response for a given CorrelationID
    Given I have a CorrelationID from Application "A"
    And the request associated with the CorrelationID has completed
    When I query Application "A" with the CorrelationID
    Then I receive a response with a HTTP Permanent Redirect Status Code

  Scenario: Showing a general progress indicator whether a request has completed or not
    Given I have a CorrelationID from Application "A"
    And the request associated with the CorrelationID has not completed
    When I query Application "A" with the CorrelationID
    Then I receive a response with an Accepted HTTP Status Code

  Scenario: Showing a specific progress indicator with specific steps during the processing of a request
    Given I have a CorrelationID from Application "A"
    And the request associated with the CorrelationID has completed Step 1 of 2 Steps
    When I query Application "A" with the CorrelationID
    Then I receive a response with an Accepted HTTP Status Code
    And a msg in the body with "50% complete"

  Scenario: Receiving a Not Found response for a given CorrelationID
    Given I have a CorrelationID from Application "A"
    And the CorrelationID is not associated with any request
    When I query Application "A" with the CorrelationID
    Then I receive a response with a Not Found HTTP Status Code

  Scenario: When a service calls an upstream service which is down
    Given Application "B" is down
    And Application "A" is up
    When I submit a command to Application "A"
    Then I receive a response which contains a CorrelationID
    And I receive a response with an Accepted HTTP Status Code

  Scenario: When an upstream service recovers and stored messages are forwarded on
    Given Application "B" is down
    When I submit a command to Application "A"
    And I bring Application "B" up
    And I query Application "A" with the CorrelationID
    Then I receive a response with a HTTP OK Status
